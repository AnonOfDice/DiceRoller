# DiceRoller

LASTE VERSION: 1.2.3 (bugfixes)
There are still crashes when passing some characters to the parser, but they go beyond intentional usage. This could probably be exploited, but I doubt this shitty dice roller will become famous enough that it will be an issue.

For usage consult the readme inside. I didn't quite manage to make it format properly in the .md format. I am the big dumdum.

This program requires SDL2 and SDL2 Image. You can find both at https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

This program also features resources by game-icons.net; all the authors are properly credited in the readme. The pictures are included into a compressed folder. Please decompress them into a folder of the same name in the same path

This program also also features a collection of random tables collected from the internet. Contact me if some of it is yours and you want it pulled down.

The makefile has been generated with the cbp2make tool (https://github.com/dmpas/cbp2make). I hope it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't reflect on the quality of the tool, I must have used it wrong.



This is my first program. If I made some mistake somewhere (especially with credits) please let me know.
