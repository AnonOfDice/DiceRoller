Consult the Readme inside for usage consult the readme inside. I didn't quite manage to make it format properly in the .md format.

This program requires SDL2 and SDL2 Image. You can find both at https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
This program also features resources by game-icons.net; all the authors are properly credited in the readme.
The makefile has been generated with the cbp2make tool (https://github.com/dmpas/cbp2make). I hope it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't reflect on the quality of the tool, I must have used it wrong.

This is my first program. If I made some mistake somewhere (especially with credits and licensing) please let me know.
